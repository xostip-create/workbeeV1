     * E&F WorkBee Security Rules Documentation
     *
     * Core Philosophy:
     * This ruleset implements a strict path-based ownership model for user account management. 
     * Security is enforced by ensuring that a user can only interact with the document 
     * that corresponds to their own Firebase Authentication UID.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * User data is stored at the root level under the /users/ collection, where each 
     * document ID is the UID of the user (/users/{userId}).
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * 1. Strict Isolation: No user can read or write data belonging to another user.
     * 2. No Public Listing: The /users collection cannot be listed by any user. Users 
     *    can only 'get' their own document.
     * 3. Identity Anchoring: We enforce that the 'id' field within the UserAccount 
     *    document matches the document ID and the user's Auth UID.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * To ensure high performance and strict relational integrity, the 'id' of the user 
     * is denormalized directly into the UserAccount document. This allows for simple, 
     * non-recursive rules that validate the relationship between the Auth state, 
     * the document path, and the internal data.
